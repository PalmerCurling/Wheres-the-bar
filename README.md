Where's-the-bar
==============
This app's original concepting was developed at Hack RU Fall 2013, but its implementation was aggressively mediocre. It did not take advantage of Yelp for improved bar-finding, nor did it utilize twilio; additionally, the old version had many graphical issues. This is a new and improved Where's the bar, and it's ready for primetime (except for the fact I have no money in twilio to make it so... so it's not, actually. Small details.)
